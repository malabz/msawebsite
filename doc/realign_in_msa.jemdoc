Its refinement follows:
. Construct a new guide tree utilizing a new distance matrix based on the MSA.
. Remove an edge from the new guide tree to obtain two new subtrees.
. Realign the sequences in each subtree.
. Align the two profiles associated with the two subtrees to get a global MSA.

Until convergence.
- This method is the same as MUSCLE's refinement.
- The source code is not publicized.
