Horizontal-oriented realignment:
. Construct a new guide tree utilizing a new distance matrix based on the MSA.
. Remove an edge from the new guide tree to obtain two new subtrees.
. Realign the sequences in each subtree.
. Align the two profiles associated with the two subtrees to get a global MSA.

Until convergence.
- The source code is not publicized.

This tool implements three different horizontal partitioning methods to realign:
. Random partitioning
. Tree-dependent partitioning and each time randomly cut a edge of the guiding tree.
. Tree-dependent partitioning and each edge of the tree is cut only once in the breath-first order.

Horizontal-oriented realignment:
. Randomly divide the alignment into two profiles
. Realign the two profiles.

Until convergence or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.
