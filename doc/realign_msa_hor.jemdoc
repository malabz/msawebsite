== Horizontal-oriented realignment in MSA tools

=== 1. MULTALIGN (1987)

=== 2. PRRP (1996)

=== [https://genome.cshlp.org/content/13/4/721.full 3. MLAGAN (2002)]
The tool's realignment is optional, which is also single-type partitioning, following:
. Find segments of sequence Xi that align better than a given cutoff, in the existing multiple alignment. These segments are the anchors between Xi and the other sequences.
. Realign Xi to the multiple alignment of the other sequences with LAGAN.

=== 4. MAFFT

=== 5. MUSCLE

=== [https://genome.cshlp.org/content/15/2/330.short 6. ProbCons (2004)]
Random partitioning realignment:
. Randomly divide the alignment into two profiles. 
. Realign the two profiles.

Until a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.

Before the realignment, this tool calculate a distance matrix from the initial alignment, construct a phylogenetic tree from the distance matrix, calculate pair weights from the phylogenetic tree, then *iteratively realign* the alignment using the phylogenetic tree and the pair weights:

Tree-dependent partitioning realignment:
. Divide the alignment into two groups based on a randomly chosen branch of the tree.
. Realign the sequences in each subtree.
Get a new alignment until no better weighted SP score is obtained.

Repeat steps from the begining of calculate a distance matrix from the new alignment to iteratively realign until the weighted SP score of the alignment dose not improve anymore.

Single-type partitioning realignment:
. Select one sequence.
. Realign it with the others.

Until all sequences realign.

=== [https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/23/9/1073/272774 10. COBALT (2007)]
Tree-dependent partitioning realignment:
. Partition the current initial alignment into two profiles separated by a edge (*Not its longest one*.)
. Realign the two profiles.

For each edge, this repeats up to five times, or as long as the best score from the current iteration improves the best score from the previous iteration by at least 2%.
- (Optional) Perform refinement by determining a new set of constraints and iterative tree-dependent partitioning realignment.

=== [https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/24/4/492/207730 11. PRALINEâ„¢ (2008)]
Tree-dependent partitioning realignment:
. Partition the current initial alignment into two profiles separated by each edge (one iterative cycle means that each edge of the tree is visited once.)
. Realign the two profiles.
. The new alignment is retained only if a higher SP score is achieved. 

Until a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.

Random partitioning realignment:
. Randomly divide the alignment into two profiles. (its own pseudo random number generator based on the linear congruential method for random partitioning)
. Realign the two profiles.

=== [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24855-9_26 15. PAAA (2011)]
Tree-dependent partitioning realignment:
. Construct a new guide tree utilizing a new distance matrix based on the MSA.
. Remove an edge from the new guide tree to obtain two new subtrees.
. Realign the sequences in each subtree.
. Align the two profiles associated with the two subtrees to get a global MSA.

Until convergence.

This tool implements three different horizontal partitioning methods to realign:
. Random partitioning
. Tree-dependent partitioning and each time randomly cut a edge of the guiding tree.
. Tree-dependent partitioning and each edge of the tree is cut only once in the breath-first order.

Tree-dependent partitioning realignment:
