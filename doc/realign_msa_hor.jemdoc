Single-type partitioning realignment:
. Select one sequence.
. Realign it with the others.

Until all sequences realign.

Random partitioning realignment:
. Randomly divide the alignment into two profiles. (its own pseudo random number generator based on the linear congruential method for random partitioning)
. Realign the two profiles.

Until a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.

Tree-dependent partitioning realignment:
. Construct a new guide tree utilizing a new distance matrix based on the MSA.
. Remove an edge from the new guide tree to obtain two new subtrees.
. Realign the sequences in each subtree.
. Align the two profiles associated with the two subtrees to get a global MSA.

Until convergence.

This tool implements three different horizontal partitioning methods to realign:
. Random partitioning
. Tree-dependent partitioning and each time randomly cut a edge of the guiding tree.
. Tree-dependent partitioning and each edge of the tree is cut only once in the breath-first order.

Random partitioning realignment:
. Randomly divide the alignment into two profiles
. Realign the two profiles.

Until convergence or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.

=== [Javad Sadri's work (2013)]
Tree-dependent partitioning realignment:
. Randomly select an edge and cut it into two subtrees.
. Realign the two profiles.
. If the result is improved, the guide tree is changed. Otherwise, the previous guide tree is retained.

Until a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.

Its realignment does not employ iterative methods.
. Create two new families based on the distance matrix obtain from the initial alignment.
. Realign the two families.
