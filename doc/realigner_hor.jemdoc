== Realigners based on horizontal partitioning
Split an alignment into groups of whole sequences, which are then merged together by realigning between groups, possibly using each groupâ€™s induced subalignment.

In each iteration has a traversal of all sequence:
. Pick a sequence
. Realign the sequence with the profile constructed with the remaining sequences.
. If the new alignment's quality is improved, the new one will replace the old one.

Until the alignment score saturates to a stable value.

In each iteration:
. Randomly pick a sequence.
. Realign the sequence with the profile constructed with the remaining sequences.
. Update the alignment if the accuracy improved.

Until the score converges or the reach the limit of iterations.

This realigner is based on three-dimensional alignment rather than using an iterative approach.

=== [https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/34/9/2598/2401672 4. REFINER (2006)]
This realigner is similar to RF method but aims to realign the sequences with the family block models representing conserved sequence/structure regions.

In each iteration:
. Randomly pick a sequence.
. Realign the sequence with the PSSM constructed with the remaining sequences.
. Update the alignment.

Until the alignment score saturates to a stable value or until the iteration cycle terminates.

In each iteration:
. Build a profile from the initial alignment.
. All sequences realign with the profile to obtain the reformed alignment. (There has a profile fine-tuning model.)
. The alignment with better quality will be the input of next iteration.

 Until the alignment between two successive runs remains unchanged or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.
