= Realignment Methods


== [realigner_ver.html Vertical partitioning realigners]
Cut the input sequences into substrings, and once these shorter substrings are realigned, they stitch their alignments together.

== [realigner_hor.html Horizontal partitioning realigners]
Split an alignment into groups of whole sequences, which are then merged together by realigning between groups, possibly using each groupâ€™s induced subalignment.

There are three restricted partitioning techniques:

1. Single-type partitioning

2. Double-type partitioning

3. Tree-dependent partitioning

== [realigner_both.html Realigners based on vertical and horizontal partitioning]

== [realign_in_msa.html Realignment in MSA tools]
